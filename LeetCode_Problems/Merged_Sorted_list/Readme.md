<!-- Approach -->

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

1. Just use the collection framework in java
2. Traverse Both linked list and add the all values in array
3. Sort the array
4. With the help of loop, create the linked list.

Time complexity :- O(n + m)

n = length of linked list1.
m = length of linked list2.
