Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

<!-- Approach -->

1. Declare a flag variable that indicate true or false.

2. Create a stack that helps to pop the element from the top element.

3. Add the pop element in the list until the stack is not empty.

Time complexity :- O(H).
