Approach

step1 :- Pass the empty string in the function.
step2 :- When add the 0 in the string then check the condition.
[if last character of the string is not 0 then add the 0 through recursive call {Previously check if the length is greater then 0(Othewise -1 comes that is out of bounds)}]
step3 :- if the string is empty then add the 0.

Time complexity:- O(n*2^n).
