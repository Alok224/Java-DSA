Given a rod of length n inches and an array price[], where price[i] denotes the value of a piece of length i. Your task is to determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

Note: n = size of price, and price[] is 1-indexed array.

<!-- Approach -->

1. Ek simple si identification thi. Isme multiple choices allowed thi. 

2. Ek hi rod ko same length m baar baar cut kr skte the but maximum profit hona chayie.

3. Toh unbounded knapsack ka use kiya.

4. Same approach as knapsack problem
