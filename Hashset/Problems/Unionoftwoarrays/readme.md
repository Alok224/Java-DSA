Union Of two arrays

<!-- Approach -->

1. Two approaches. 1--> Hashmap, 2--> Hashset

2. By using hashset, apply for loops in both array and add the elements in set.

3. print the set.

4. By using hashmap just put the elements in map by for loop and check that key is not repeated(map.containskey()).

5. print the keyset.

Time complexity :- O(n).
